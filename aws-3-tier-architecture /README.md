we’ll set up two EC2 instances: one in a public subnet with a public IP for internet access, and another in a private subnet without direct internet connectivity.

To enable software updates for the private instance, we’ll implement a NAT gateway in the public subnet with an Elastic IP. We’ll configure routes to allow the private instance to communicate through the NAT gateway.

Additionally, we’ll create an RDS instance running Postgres in the private subnet, accessible only from the private EC2 instance. This setup ensures a secure environment with controlled internet access and database isolation.
